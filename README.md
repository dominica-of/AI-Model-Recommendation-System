# GenAI-Powered Model Recommender System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to recommend AI models using Large Language Models (LLMs) and structured scoring. It serves as the technical foundation for the Master’s thesis “Development and Evaluation of a GenAI Recommender System for AI Model Selection” by Abena Amanfo (Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Master of Science in Applied Information and Data Science (MScIDS), Spring Semester, 2025).

## Key Features

- **GenAI-Powered Recommendation**: GPT-4-turbo generates justifiable model suggestions.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines structured PostgreSQL metadata with semantically retrieved text from ChromaDB.
- **Multi-Criteria Scoring Engine**: Evaluates models based on performance, popularity, licensing, hardware compatibility, documentation, and institutional credibility.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with Streamlit to allow users to describe projects and receive real-time recommendations.


## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Insert Data into Databases

- **PostgreSQL (Structured):**

```bash
python backend/insert_data.py
```

- **ChromaDB (Embeddings):**

```bash
python backend/insert_chromadb.py
```

> Ensure both PostgreSQL and ChromaDB services are running locally or available via remote endpoints.

### 3. Launch Web Interface

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Example Prompt

> Describe your project , e.g.:
>
> *"I need a model that performs named entity recognition on legal documents using PyTorch and must be open-source."*

The system retrieves the top candidate models from ChromaDB, fetches metadata from PostgreSQL, and generates a reasoned recommendation using GPT-4.

## Data Security & Deployment

- PostgreSQL and ChromaDB operate in isolated environments with role-based access.
- API keys are stored securely via `.env` or `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.

## Scoring Engine Explanation

Navigate to the **"Scoring Engine Explanation"** tab in the Streamlit UI to:

- View individual scoring formulas.
- Explore the impact of each dimension.
- Understand how models are ranked and selected.
